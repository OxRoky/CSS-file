        <p>Hi! My name Roky Sorker Welcome to my personal page that I’ve designed to showcase my skills and expertise that I’ve accumulated over the year. I’ve also placed all my social links at the left side, feel free to connect with me. I’d love to be given the opportunity to hear from you.

            I like to call myself “a passionate computer science teacher”. I always had a wish on my mind that I will do something for the computer science students that’s why I made lots of videos on different subjects. My first priority is making the subject more interesting and clear so you can feel it and don’t get bore.  </p>

                Unless you're reading a PDF or a printed version of this page, this content is made up of various HTML elements and text. HTML is the content layer of the web. HTML elements are the nodes that make up the This HTML course for web developers provides a solid overview for developers, from novice to expert level HTML. If you're completely new to HTML, you will learn how to build structurally sound content. If you've been building websites for years, this course may fill in gaps in knowledge that you didn't even know you had.</p>
